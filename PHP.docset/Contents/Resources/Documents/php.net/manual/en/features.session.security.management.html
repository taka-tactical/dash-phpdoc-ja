     The session module cannot guarantee that the information you store
     in a session is only viewed by the user who created the session. You
     need to take additional measures to protect the confidentiality
     of the session, depending on the value associated with it.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
     Assess the importance of the data carried by your sessions and
     deploy additional protections -- this usually comes at a price,
     reduced convenience for the user. For example, if you want to
     protect users from simple social engineering tactics, you need to
     enable <em>session.use_only_cookies</em>. In that case,
     cookies must be enabled unconditionally on the user side, or
     sessions will not work.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
     There are several ways to leak an existing session ID to third
     parties. e.g. JavaScript injections, session ID in URLs, packet
     sniffing, physical access to device. A leaked session ID enables
     the third party to access all resources which are associated with
     a specific ID. First, URLs carrying session IDs. If you link to
     an external site, the URL including the session ID might be
     stored in the external site&#039;s referrer logs. Second, a more
     active attacker might listen to your network traffic. If it is
     not encrypted, session IDs will flow in plain text over the
     network. The solution here is to implement SSL/TLS on your server
     and make it mandatory for users. HSTS should be used for better
     security.

     Even HTTPS cannot protect confidential data at all times.
     For example the CRIME and Beast vulnerabilities may enable an

     set up such a proxy.

    it, an uninitialized session ID is rejected and a new session ID is
    created. This prevents an attack that forces users to use known session
    ID. Attacker may paste links or send mail that contains the session
    ID. e.g. http://example.com/page.php?PHPSESSID=123456789 If <a href="session.configuration.html#ini.session.use-trans-sid" class="link">session.use_trans_sid</a> is

    The session ID cookie could be set with domain, path, httponly and secure
